title: Make a Simple API Endpoint with Vercel Serverless Functions

Create a simple Node API on Vercel Serverless functions in under 20
minutes. But first some preamble!

A while back (3 years ago) I made a [Positivity API], it was a really
simple array of positive quotes that's used in the [#100DaysOfCode
twitter bot] which is [still in use today]! I contributed a lot to
that bot [back in the day]!

This time around I've made some random words that are going to be used
to make blog a name!

## Set up

```bash
yarn global add vercel
# or use vc login
vercel login
```

## Create project

```bash
mkdir random-name-generator
cd random-name-generator
yarn init -y
```

```bash
yarn add -D vercel
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vercel dev",
  "deploy": "vercel deploy --prod"
},
```

```bash
mkdir api
touch -p api/index.ts
```

```ts
import { NowRequest, NowResponse } from '@vercel/node'

export default (req: NowRequest, res: NowResponse) => {
  return res.json({ message: 'Hello World' })
}
```

Run it locally `yarn dev`
