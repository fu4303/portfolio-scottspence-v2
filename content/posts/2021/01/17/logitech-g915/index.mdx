## How did I get mine

I shouldn't be allowed near Amazon after a few drinks! I managed to
buy a Spanish version of the keyboard (I'm in the UK). When it arrived
I was quite shocked to see ES on the front and that the keys were GL
Tactile and not clicky, then I checked the order and that was exactly
what I had ordered. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I was so wrapped up in actually seeing one was available and that I
could purchase in five instalments that I went and hit that buy
button!

## No clack!

Now I'm using tactile keys, I'll say that the feel is pretty much the
same, the audable click is something I'll miss but not something I
feel.

I do spend a lot of time with my headphones on now whilst working so
it's not a massive loss.

## Things I miss

The G keys on the G815 I've become reliant on the G1 button which was
linked to the F5 key, I ofthen find myself hitting the Ctrl key
wanting to refresh a page.

With the 104 keys of the G815 my left hand naturayy rested between the
Tab, Caps, Shift and Ctrl keys and the G keys, now my hand wanders.

There's also the number pad gone, I have always been accustomed to
having a num pad on keyboards, I used to work for a bank and those num
pads were essential for number entry.

Now both my hands don't have the usual bumpers of the G keys and the
num pad.
