[Fedora Remix for WSL] was on sale for Â£2.51 so I thought I'd have a
look see and add it to the rest of the other WSL distros I have
installed.

As I'm all jazzed about using Cypress in WSL I thought I'd give it a
go on Fedora.

There's a few dependencies that are detailed by the Cypress CLI output
that helps you underestand what needs to be installed, there were a
few that took a bit of searching to find but I've got it working in
now.

Unlike the post [I did previously] on doing it with Debian based WSL
instances like Ubuntu and Debian there's no need to set the
**$DISPLAY** variable like detailed in [Nicky's post].

Also I didn't configure to [Automatically start `dbus`] or [Grant
passwordless access for `dbus`]. Right, enough link love to Nicky's
site!

Here's the dependencies I needed to install:

```bash
sudo dnf install \
  \ libX11
  \ libX11-xcb
  \ nss
  \ libdrm
  \ libgbm
  \ libasound
  \ libXv -y
```

There was one part for `libnss3.so` missing but I couldn't find
anything matching `libnss` using the the search command:

```bash
sudo dnf search libnss
```

In the comments of this [Stack Overflow question]

```bash
sudo yum install alsa-lib.x86_64
```
