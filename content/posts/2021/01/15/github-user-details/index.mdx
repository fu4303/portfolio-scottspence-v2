  Using the GitHub GraphQL API in a serverless function - GraphQL vs
  REST

I started playing around with the GitHub GraphQL API endpoint to do
something I've been meaning to do for a wile now, that's to make a
serverless function that will return the GitHub stats from my GitHub
profile.

Me doing this came up in conversation with my friend [Paul Scanlon]
and he decided to do something similar but with the GitHub REST API,
so we are making notes on how things are going!!

What I'm doing is based off of several [Leigh Halliday] videos on
using the GitHub GraphQL API and adding that data to a graph, I
extended that and added a calendar/heatmap of all my GitHub
contributions too.

â„¹ Leigh has just released [Next Level Next.js] where you can get $10
off with my affiliate link.

## Approach

The idea is to use a serverless function that will take in a GitHub
usename and use that to

I wanted to use Playwright but that didn't work on Vercel so a
reverted to Puppeteer like with the [serverless open graph image]
project I made a while back now.

I went with Google chart library first as it had what I needed
(Pie/Doughnut and Heatmap) but it's not responsive.

## Latency

Loading the image does take a while, I've added this one below the
fold but because it's not part of Gatsby image there will be layout
shift unless I add a default heihgt to the `img` tag.

## Interactive example

You can check out the latency by changing my username in the live code
example here:

```js react-live
const user = `spences10`

const Image = () => {
  return (
    <img
      alt="GitHub user language split"
      style={{ width: '100%', height: '315px' }}
      src={`https://ghui.vercel.app/pie.png?username=${user}`}
    />
  )
}

render(Image)
```

## Big boi function

I was poking around with the function on Vercel and found that the
size was at 90% ðŸ˜¬

This didn't really bode well as I'd only finished one part of it, the
next part will be a heat map.
