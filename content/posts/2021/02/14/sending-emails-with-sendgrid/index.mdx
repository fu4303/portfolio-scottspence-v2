Now I have a super sweet email pipeline for sending weekly emails
thanks to [Sam Larsen-Disney] I'm going to document what I've learnt
and what Sam taught me. (same thing, I guess) ðŸ˜Š

First up, I'd like to thank Sam for his patience walking me through
this a couple of time over.

If you are looking to do something similar then the hope is that this
can give you an idea of what you need to do.

## Prerequisites

There's no real

A custom email address to send from, I have done this in the past with
Zoho and you can check [Setting up a Custom Email with Zoho] for
details on that.

A from on your site to collect the information with, I use Kews Forms
which isn't completely redundant a this point as it has great
validation that can be used.

Also it was what I had in place already, if you're interested in Kews
Forms take a look at the video here:

There are also other videos from friends of mine detailing the same
process:

- [Leigh Halliday]
- [James Q Quick]

This is the code Sam kindly furnished me with, this can be gleaned
from SendGrid as well.

```js
/**
 * This is what is used to send the contact to SendGrid
 * the `list_ids` is from my contacts list in SendGrid
 * that is the id of my Newsletter list
 */

export default async function happyForm(email, name, list) {
  await fetch('https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts', {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GATSBY_SENDGRID_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      list_ids: [list],
      contacts: [
        {
          email,
          first_name: name,
        },
      ],
    }),
  })
}
```

To do that, if you create a new list in your contacts then

![sendgrid empty contact list]
