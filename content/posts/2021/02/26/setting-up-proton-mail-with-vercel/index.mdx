I've decided to give ProtonMail a shot, I have lost faith in Google
being a force for good and coming round to the notion that [I have
been their product] for the last 15 years or so. ðŸ˜¬

ProtonMail is the top rated alternitive on [nomoregoogle.com] and with
end-to-end encryption and the company based in Switzerland with strict
Swiss privacy laws I think my mail is in a good place!

You also sign up anonymously for ProtonMail when you first sign up,
all they take is a username and password then a secondary email as a
backup for account resets if needed.
