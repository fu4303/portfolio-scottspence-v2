## Hi I'm Scott

</Small>

I'm a web developer for Creative Products at [Karmarama], based in
Farringdon, London UK. Currently working from home.

I'm a second career dev, that reskilled from a VBA analyst developer
role into web development.

I have (as of <DateUpdated date={`2021-01-20`}/>) a 1,486 day GitHub
streak, there are several OSS projects I like to contribute to the
majority of my commits are for my projects, feel free to take a look
ðŸ‘€

I'm a massive fan of the [jamstack] and in particular the progressive
web app generator [Gatsby]. Right now I'm enjoying integrating that
with as many things as possible, here are some examples:

- [This site]
- [Cheat Sheets]
- [My CV]

More details in the [portfolio section].

### Sectors I have worked in:

Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas, Lloyd's
insurance market. As a web developer I've worked in government digital
transformation and now creative digital.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

## My interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!

If there's anything you want to ask, you can [Ask Me Anything]

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan, I have a Spotify playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/4etN3fawLp5rWiAFdJZQp5?si=bWljWzzsTq2kFj6hq5f-lQ"
  width="100%"
/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be the UKF Drum and Bass Top 100:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/0Zarq4BVkFkZOWkmqsfrjA?si=x3WLxJnVS12NVWWDt1LUXg"
  width="100%"
/>

### Now Playing - Spotify ðŸŽ§

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:
