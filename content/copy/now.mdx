### Work

Working as a Web Developer for [Karmarama], using a variety of
technologies.

I'm evangelising the jamstack to anyone that will listen on the team
and we have used Gatsby in several projects now, [asi.style] being one
of the first.

I have estimated and delivered a project in Preact utilising Lottie
animations in a guided tour with action points to give more
information.

Recently documented the migration plan of a project from a legacy
server and suggested the next iteration of the project.

### Play

I'm still playing Borderlands 3! With the Legendary collection on the
Switch I'm now playing Borderlands 2 again!!

Due to COVID19 gym hasn't been happening ðŸ˜¢
